## What is SABER?
SABER (Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research) is a library of containerized tools and a workflow deployment system for enabling processing of large neuroimaging datasets. Current workflows include processing of X-ray Microtomorography data to produce cell density estimates as well as processing Electron Microscopy images to segment neuron bodies. 
This project builds on Apache Airflow (http://airflow.apache.org) to orchestrate workflow deployment. This project interfaces with Datajoint (https://datajoint.io) and bossDB (https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss) to enable data storage and reproducible workflows. 

## Prerequisites
SABER requires docker and docker-compose. Please use the latest versions. To run our example workflows, you will need an AWS account to enable cloud storage through the AWS S3 service (https://aws.amazon.com/account/). To access data for our example workflows you will need an account at https://api.bossdb.org

## Installation
Simply clone this repository and run
`docker-compose up -d` inside it!

**NOTE:** on a Mac this is just `docker compose up -d` (assuming Docker desktop is installed)

## Execution of workflows

Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/aplbrain/saber/wiki) for more information!

## Data Access

Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/aplbrain/saber/wiki/Data-Access) for more information about public access to data for testing Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microtomography workflows.
